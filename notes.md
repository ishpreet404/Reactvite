two types of routing 
client side :- anchor tag 
server side routing :- link
Link does not refreshes the whole page and imporves performace as compared to anchor tag here header will not be rerndered or refreshed only outlet gets refreshes that is  why react websites are knows as Single page application  
when class is instantiated constructor is called then render method is called 
in a parent chd relationship parent componenet did mount is called after the child life cycle is finished and rendered thats why it used to call api in class based components
component did update/mount/unmout
